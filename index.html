    <h1>HTML Live Text</h1>
    <p>
      A design element idea for a textual element on a site which is connected
      to a live data feed and continuously refreshes itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reloading is indicated by a stripe shifting across the text similar to
      how an indeterminate progress indicator element might appear:
    </p>
    <progress></progress>
    <p>
      Here's an example where you can control whether the element appears to be
      reloading or not:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span id="demoSpan" class="loading">A live value</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <input id="toggleInput" type="checkbox" checked />
      <label for="toggleInput">Loading…</label>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this next example, the element displays the current time as if it was
      coming from the server and updated sporadically. It updates for between
      one and two seconds and then stays still for between one and five seconds
      and this process repeats infinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span id="timeDemoSpan">Loading…</span>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
