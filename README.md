A prototype of a design element of a connected text element which indicates it
is reloading by having a stripe shift across it similarly to indeterminate
progress indicator.

## To-Do

### Pull out the screencast stuff to its own repo and use it here as a dep

### Figure out why the `startScreencast` method has layers shifted

And if I can do something about that or if it is a Puppeteer thing.

### Resize the window to match the viewport for the screencast one
